# 🚀 WebDevWeb API

A robust backend REST API designed for managing development teams and corporate entities. Built with a modern Python stack, this project demonstrates **Clean Architecture**, **Asynchronous Programming**, and **Production-Ready Infrastructure**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Async)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Async Engine)
- **Migrations:** Alembic
- **Validation:** Pydantic v2
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Testing:** Pytest

---

## 🎯 Architecture & Features

This project focuses on architectural patterns and scalability rather than just feature quantity.

- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns using Repositories, Services, and Routers.
- **Full Async Support:** Fully asynchronous database operations for high performance.
- **Database Schema:** Complex relational model including `Teams`, `Projects`, `Employees`, `Clients`, and `Orders`.
- **Implemented API:**
  - ✅ **Teams**: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - 🚧 **Other Entities**: Database models are implemented to demonstrate relationships, but API endpoints are currently out of scope.
- **Automated Infrastructure:**
  - Automatic database migrations on container startup.
  - Data persistence via Docker volumes.
  - Health checks and dependency management.

## 🔧 Local Development (Without Docker)
If you prefer to run the app locally (e.g., for debugging):

1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run Database: Ensure you have a local PostgreSQL instance running and update your .env to point to localhost.

3. Apply Migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

4. Start Server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:main_app --reload
```
